# 01. Intro Linux
# Part 1. OS
# Part 2. History
# Part 3. OpenSource

# 02. Setting
# Part 1. Virtual Machine 
# Part 2. Kali Linux
#     - Kali Linux download (https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms)
#     - Install on UTM (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zdjQ9w_v_4&ab_channel=KskRoyal)
#        = Error Kali needs at least 30GB
# Part 3. Command
#     - CLI
#     - Shell
#     - Command Structure (1. Command 2. Argument 3. Option)
#         which id (the command belongs to some programs)
# 03. Directory
# Part 1. Current directory - pwd
# Part 2. Directory movement 
#     - Directory files check - ls
#     - Change Directory - cd
# Part 3. Home Directory (~) - cd ~
#     - Switch User - su
# Part 4. File information - ls [file name or directory path] -l
#     - (.) hidden files => ls -a
# Part 5. Kali Linux File System
#     - /bin = Binary, execute files
#     - /dev = device, connecting hardware device
#     - /etc = setting files
#     - /home = each account home directory
#     - /lib = library, sharing folders
#     - /sbin = system administrator files
#     - /tmp = temporary, anyone can use this directory, delete after shutdown
#     - /var = save files in programs
# Part 6. Absolute Path vs Relative Path
#    - https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linux-path-absolute-relative
#    - ./ = current location
#    - ../ = higher location
# 04. File
# Part 1. Vi Text Editor - Note
#    - Vi mode (Edit mode [Excute: i] / Command mode [esc button back to the mode])
#    - Command mode (:w = Save, :q = exit)
#    - Search (on command mode) = /[search word]
#    - Specific line = :[line number] , line delete (dd)
# Part 2. Check files
#    - cat [txt file name]
#    - It can read txt file only
#    - file [file name] = text file type
#    - more = it shows on the top
# Part 3. COPY
#    - cp cp_test ./Desktop/        = copy [src] [dst]
#    - cp cp_test ./Desktop/copy_test    = change the file name
#    - mkdir normal_dir          = create a folder
#    - cp -r normal_dir ./copy_dir      = directory copy
# Part 4. Remove
#    - rm -r ./copy_dir       = remove directory // -f force remove
# Part 5. Move
#    - mv mv_test ./Desktop/
#    - mv [current directory] [future directory]
#    - mv mv_test ./mv_changeName          = change file name
# 6. Authentication
#  - People need account for individual usages
# Part 1. UID/GID
#    - UID: User ID
#    - GID: Group ID
#    - root: highest account
#    - useradd normaltic       = create new account
#    - su normaltic
# Part 2. passwd
#    - /etc/passwd    = user information in Linux
#    - more /etc/passwd
#    - vi /etc/passwd
#    - 1. ID 2. password (/etc/shadow) 3. UID 4. GID 5. nickname of user 6. home directory 7. login shell (/usr/bin/nologin)
# Part 3. rwx
#    - r: read
#    - w: write
#    - x: execute
#    - cd /tmp      = everyone can use this directory
#    - (1) owner authentication / (2) Group authentication / (3) Extra user authentication
# Part 4. Specialty Authority 
#    (1) setuid - when the file is executed, it executes on owner of the file
#               - -rws = setuid with execute authority
#               - -rwS = setuid without execute authority
#    (2) setgid - when the file is executed, it executes for group of the file
#    (3) sticky bit - setting of directory
#                   - anyone can create a file, but the creator only delete the created file.
# Part 5. Change Authority
#    - chmod
#    - u         r
#    - g    +,-  w
#    - o         x
