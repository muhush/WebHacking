# 1. Identification / Authentication
#   1) Identification and Authentication together
//pseudocode
$sql = "select * from member where id='$user=_id' and pass='$user_pass'"
$ret = $sql.execute()
if($ret) { //login success }
else     { //login fail    }

#   2) Identification / Authentication separately
//pseudocode
$sql = "select * from member where id='$user=_id'" and pass='$user_pass'"
$db_pass = $sql.execute()
if($db_pass == $user_pass) { // login success }
else { // login fail }

# 2. Cookie / Session / SessionID
# Cookie: A small piece of data stored on the user's computer by the web browser while browsing a website. Cookies are used to remember information about the user, such as login status or site preferences, across different sessions.
# Session: A server-side storage of information that is used to maintain user state between HTTP requests. Unlike cookies, session data is stored on the server and can keep sensitive information secure from client-side access.
# Session ID: A unique identifier that is typically stored in a cookie on the user's browser or passed in the URL. This ID maps to the session data stored on the server, allowing the server to retrieve the user's session information on subsequent requests.
